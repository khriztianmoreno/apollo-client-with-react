# Apollo Client with React

Basic React application integrating Apollo Client for communication with GitHub GraphQL API V4

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the base project to run on your local machine for academic purposes to carry out this example.

### Prerequisities

You can now [create your own personal API tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for use in scripts and on the command line. Be careful, these tokens are like passwords so you should guard them carefully. The advantage to using a token over putting your password into a script is that a token can be revoked, and you can generate lots of them. Head on over to your settings to manage personal API tokens.


## Install & Run

> Don't forget to replace the `token` variable with your own API token for GitHub

```bash
# Install project dependencies
$ npm install 

# Run project
$ npm start
```
